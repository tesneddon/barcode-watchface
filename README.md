Barcode Pebble Watchface
========================

This watchface, built for the [Pebble Smartwatch](http://getpebble.com), is
based on the format of the [6-digit UPC-E (Universal Product Code) barcode]
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Product_Code#UPC-E). The time is
displayed both as an odd-parity barcode with the decimal form of the time
below it, see the screen shot below:

    ....

As well as telling the time in a unique and interesting format, this watchface
offers the following extra configurable features:

  * Display the current date as UPC-E barcode, by using the "tap".
  * When the Pebble Smartwatch looses connectivity with the phone this
    watchface will alert you with a vibration and a warning.  It will also
    indicate when connectivity has been restored.  A great feature if you
    have a habbit of leaving your phone behind.
  * A low battery indicator.  You can set how low triggers the alarm,
    but when the battery reaches the specified level it will indicate
    this by vibrating and displaying a message showing how much battery
    is left.
