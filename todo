* Project webpage - ESS
* Need configuration page for below...
* Configuration for Watchface.
    * Does the tap show the date?
    * Does tap show the weather?
    * What level do we complain about the battery?
    * Do we complain about the phone losing connection?
* Can we get access to any button?
* Comments!

* Use ESS colour scheme...

* Configuration...
  -- we need to fetch the existing persistent data from the phone
  -- build it
  -- send it to the form (as arguments)
  -- adjust with the form
  -- return
  -- send back to store in persistent data

* When the app is brought to the foreground, we need to work out we are
  being configured and display the configuration image (the cogs)

* When we are done, display "Tick" and "Configuration Complete!"  Then we
  need to go.
